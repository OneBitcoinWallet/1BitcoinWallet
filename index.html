Publicly exposing the code can increase the risk of potential vulnerabilities and attacks. For instance, the Electrum open-source project experienced a hack in the past when someone accepted a malicious merge request, resulting in user loss of funds. Therefore, we have chosen to maintain the code privately to prioritize the safety of our users' assets.
